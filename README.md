This app is made to help professionals plan and organize their day.  It features time blocks for each hour of a regular business day.

Screenshots are attached to this repository.  The current date is displayed at the top of the app.  Each time block is color-coated based on whether that time block has passed, not passed, or is within the current hour.  Time blocks that have passed are color-coated in red.  The current time block is color-coated in light-blue.  Time blocks that have not yet passed are color-coated in grey.

As far as code-related specifics go, you'll want to reference the notes within each code document.
